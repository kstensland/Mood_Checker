Mood_Checker
====================

The purpose of this app is to get a stream from Twitter of songs posted by users. Then get a sentiment analysis on each of those songs. Then, for each user who posts a song, we get all of their other tweets posted within 24 hours of their song tweet. Then we do sentiment analysis on their tweets to see if there is a correlation between the moods of their tweets and the mood of the music they listen to.
